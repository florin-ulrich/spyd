how to handle potentially irrelevant yt results:

check whether yt vid title contains song name (minus features)
if yes: proceed normally
if no: prompt user with best 5 results and let them choose which one to download

other: save files with songnames from spotify, not youtube titles (can i even do that?)
-answer: no, but i can store the songnames processed and then rename them after going by
time added and list index
